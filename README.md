# Large-transacional-dataset
Many researches about association rules mining and frequent itemsets mining need large transactional dataset for study. However, few large datasets can be found. In this repository, I offer some large transactional datasets transformed from other datasets. 
## USCensus1990t
This dataset contains 2458285 transactions and 396 items. It is transformed from the data USCensus1990 [1] which can be founded in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/US+Census+Data+%281990%29.
## SUSYd5t
This dataset contains 5000000 transactions and 92 items. It is transformed from the data SUSY [2] which can be founded in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY.
